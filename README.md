### Hi there 👋, I'm Chantel Punt
#### Fullstack Developer
As a software engineer with four years of experience, I have developed a strong foundation in frontend development and design. Over the years, I have honed my skills in creating intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces that enhance the user experience.  However, I have recently shifted my focus towards improving my backend programming abilities.  I am committed to learning the latest tools and technologies in this area and applying them to create robust, efficient, and scalable applications. My goal is to become a well-rounded software engineer with expertise in both frontend and backend development, and to leverage this expertise to deliver exceptional products that meet the needs of end-users.
